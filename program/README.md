# Trezoa Program

Use the Trezoa Program Crate to write on-chain programs in Rust.  If writing client-side applications, use the [Trezoa SDK Crate](https://crates.io/crates/trezoa-sdk) instead.

More information about Trezoa is available in the [Trezoa documentation](https://trezoa.com/docs).

[Trezoa Program Library](https://github.com/trezoa-team/trezoa-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
