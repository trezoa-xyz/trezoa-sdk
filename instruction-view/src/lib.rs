//! Lightweight types for directing the execution of Trezoa programs.
//!
//! This crate offers views and zero-copy types to interact with program
//! instructions and accounts. As a result, it reduces compute units
//! consumption. This is achieved by defining types that hold references
//! instead of owning the required data.
